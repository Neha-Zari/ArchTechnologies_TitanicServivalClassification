# ApexcifyTechnology_TitanicServivalClassification
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at APEXCIFY Technologies.
The goal of this task was to analyze the Titanic dataset, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and visualize the results in a user-friendly dashboard using Tkinter.

#Features
Data Preprocessing
Filled missing values in Age, Embarked, and Fare
Converted categorical columns (Sex, Embarked) into numeric using one-hot encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Bar charts for gender distribution and survival vs. non-survival
Insights about which factors influenced survival

Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Compared models on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Tkinter GUI Dashboard
Tab 1: Dataset preview
Tab 2: Exploratory graphs
Tab 3: Model performance (table + accuracy comparison graph)
Tab 4: Key summary findings

Tools used:
Python
Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Tkinter

Key Findings
Females had a higher survival rate compared to males
First-class passengers had a better chance of survival
Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy
